Data for the clusters from the study:
"Reparameterization of GFN1-xTB for Atmospheric Molecular Clusters: Applications to Multi-Acidâ€“Multi-Base Systems"

Species are sulfuric acid, methanesulfuric acid, nitric acid, formic acid, ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine.
Folders contain the clusters from the improvement workflow with optimization ad frequency calculation at the wB97D-D/6-31++G** (G16) level of theory.

The Additioanl_files/initial_am_sampling.pkl file contains the clusters from the initial sampling of the ammonia-based clusters at the wB97D-D/6-31++G** level of theory with el.correction at DLPNO-CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ.

"Additional_files/param_gfn1-xtb.txt" is the parameter file for the AMC-xTB parameterization. It needs to be placed in the current "xtbpath" variable path or in the folder where the calculation is running.
