This folder contains calculations for both 1:1 ratio and off-ratio SA-AM
clusters from SA-AM to 30SA-30AM. For all .pkl files there are also a 
.tar.gz archive where all the files can be retrieved.

These are split into 3 folders:
r2SCAN-3c: Contains 21667 single-point calculations at the r2SCAN-3c level
for the GFN1-xTB structures, divided into two .pkl files.
GFN1-xTB: Contains 21667 -hess calculations at GFN1-xTB level for
structures optimized at the GFN1-xTB level, divided into two .pkl files.
r2SCAN-3c_GFN1-xTB: Combination of the two folders above, all the files
are contained in two .pkl files.
