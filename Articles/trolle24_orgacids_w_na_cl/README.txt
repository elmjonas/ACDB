Supporting data for the work:
"Modeling Local Aerosol Surface Environments: Clustering of Organic Acids, Water, and Ions".

The systems for which the data was obtained follows the notation:
w = water
na = natruim (+)
cl = chloride (-)
dhppa = 2,2-dihydroxypropanoic acid
lca = lactic acid
ppa = propionic acid
pua = pyruvic acid
pue = pyruvate 

Structure were obtained at DFT level of theory employing the wB97x-D/6-31++G(d,p) methodology
Single-point el. energy correction is calculated at DLPNO-CCSD(T_0)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory.
