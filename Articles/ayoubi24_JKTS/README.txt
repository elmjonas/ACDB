This is supplementary material for the work of Ayoubi et el. 2024.
All the data store are rather side product, eventually useful for future ML techniques, which was produced in during the construction and test excecution of the JKTS part, Jammy Key for Transition States, within the JK framework. 

Several systems were studied:
 C  CC  CCC  CCCO  CCC=O  CCO  CC=O  CO  C=O  CC(=O)C1CC(CC=O)C1(C)C
 -the last one is pinonaldehyde

Several levels of theory were used:
 B3LYP  BHandHLYP  M062X  MP2  wB97XD
 -BHandHLYP was shown as the most suitable

The file types:
 database.pkl - contains all the important QC information (JKQC readable)
 JKTS_pickles.tar.gz - contains pickles produces by JKTS and readable by JKTS. Useful during the workflow but perhaps not necessary to examine now
 JKTS_*,log,*.txt - log of the JKTS or stored results
