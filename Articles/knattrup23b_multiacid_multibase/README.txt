Here, you can find folders corresponding to clusters we performed sample or those what we reoptimized from different article.
Each folder contains subfolder for specific method (DFT = wB97D-D/6-31++G** or DLPNO = el.correction at DLPNO-CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ).
There you can find the pickled database.pkl (sometimes splitted into two part due to GitHub limit), structures and all energies.

See https://github.com/elmjonas/ACDB/tree/master/database_v2#using-the-pickled-files to understand how to handle the pickled files
