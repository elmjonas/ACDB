Here are the out file from the study Base synergy on FNPs”

This study explores base synergy in the formation of large clusters from a
mixture of SA, AM, and DMA. We calculated the binding free energies of the (SA)n(AM)x(DMA)n−x
clusters, with n from 1 to 10, where x runs from 0 to n

The QC log file obtained from ORCA. The file includes:

-The structures (xyz format) and thermochemical parameters (in out file)
are calculated at the B97-3c level of theory.


- Out file from the final single point energy of the clusters is calculated at the ωB97X-DJB3/6-
311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory
