# The Atmospheric Cluster Database(ACDB)

The purpose of this database is to compile all existing atmospheric cluster structures and thermochemical data under one common methodology. 

I urge all authors to contact me at jelm@chem.au.dk if you want structures uploaded to the database.

Please cite ... JOURNAL ... and the associated original literature if any of the structures or thermochemical properties from the database are used in your published research.
