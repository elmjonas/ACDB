# The Atmospheric Cluster Database (ACDB)

The purpose of this database is to compile existing atmospheric cluster structures and thermochemical data under one common methodology. 

Please cite J. Elm, ACS Omega, 2019, 4, 10965-10974 and the associated original literature if any of the structures or thermochemical properties from the database are used in your published research.
