Here 14557 xyz, out files for the wB97X-D calculations, and log files for the GFN1-xTB calculations can be found.
Some of the structures for which it has been calculated were found to have imaginary 
frequencies in the original --ohess GFN1-xTB optimization. However these imaginary
frequencies were not found in subsequent --hess calculations.
