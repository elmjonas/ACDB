This folder contains calculations for both 1:1 ratio and off-ratio SA-AM
clusters from SA-AM to 30SA-30AM. For all .pkl files there are also a 
.tar.gz archive where all the files can be retrieved.

equilibrium: This contains the full set of equilibrium structures,
both 1:1 ratio and off-ratio. They are gathered in 3 folders:
B97-3c: Contains 17079 single-point calculations at the B97-3c level 
for the GFN1-xTB structures divided into two .pkl files.
GFN1-xTB: 21667 -hess calculations at GFN1-xTB level for structures
optimized at the GFN1-xTB level.
B97-3c_GFN1-xTB: Combination of the two folders above, all the files are
contained in two .pkl files.


extended: Contains a subset of the equilibrium structures from 1SA1AM to
10SA10AM with the addition of non-equilibrium structures for 1SA1AM to 
5SA5AM generated using MD with a GFN1-xTB potential.
B97-3c: Contains 8472 single-point calculations at the B97-3c level for the
GFN1-xTB structures contained in 1 .pkl file.
GFN1-xTB: 8472 -hess calculations at the GFN1-xTB level for structures
optimized at the GFN1-xTB level.
B97-3c_GFN1-xTB: Combination of the two folders above, all the files are
contained in two .pkl files.
