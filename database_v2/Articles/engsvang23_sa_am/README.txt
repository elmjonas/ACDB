These folders contain the files from the calculations carried out in the
study by Engsvang et al.
There are 4 folders, 3 corresponding to calculations carried out at the 3
different levels of theory and 1 for the leftover structures for which
single-point corrections were not carried out.
The 3 folders corresponding to the full calculations are:
B97-3c_GFN1-xTB: Calculations at the B97-3c//GFN1-xTB level of theory.
r2SCAN-3c_GFN1-xTB: Calculations at the r2SCAN-3c//GFN1-xTB level of theory.
wB97X-D_GFN1-xTB: Calculations at the wB97X-D3BJ/6-311++G(3df,3pd)//GFN1-xTB
level of theory.

Additional_files: Contains the leftover structures.
