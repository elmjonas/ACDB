Here, you can find 5 folders corresponding to clusteromics I-V series.
Each folder contains subfolder for specific method.
There you can find the pickled database.pkl.
In order to standardize the databases, combine the monomer_dimer files in the Additional_files folder with the clusteromics folder.  The Additional_files folder has the monomers as well.

See https://github.com/elmjonas/ACDB/tree/master/database_v2#using-the-pickled-files to understand how to handle the pickled files
