Here, you can find 5 folders corresponding to clusteromics I-V series.
Each folder contains subfolder for specific method (GFN1-xTB or r2SCAN-3c).
There you can find the pickled database.pkl (splitted into two part due to GitHub limit).
In order to standardize the databases use the monomer_dimer files in the Additional_files folder. There you can find the monomers as well.
